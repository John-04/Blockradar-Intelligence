> Engagement & Retention Network Intelligence Engine

Built using Blockradar as a case study.

## What it does

- **Churn Risk Scoring** — ML model that scores every fintech by probability of going inactive
- **Wallet Dormancy Tracking** — identifies wallets with no activity in 60+ days
- **Regional Performance** — Africa, LatAm, Middle East & Southeast Asia breakdown
- **Transaction Volume Trends** — 18-month regional volume analysis
- **Real-time Alerts** — flags high risk fintechs before they churn

## Data Modes

Set `DATA_MODE` in `backend/.env`:

- `simulated` — generates 100k wallets & 150k transactions for demo
- `real` — connects to your live Blockradar account via API

---

## Data & API Connection

> This platform is connected to a **live Blockradar account** via their REST API. Real wallet addresses and account data are fetched directly from Blockradar's infrastructure on startup.
>
> Current account is on the free plan with 6 active wallet addresses and no transactions yet. As wallets transact, the churn model, dormancy tracker, and volume charts will populate with fully live data automatically.
>
> To run with simulated data at scale (100k wallets, 150k transactions across 100+ fintechs), set `DATA_MODE=simulated` in your `.env` file.

## Why I built this

Blockradar is a 5-person team serving 100+ fintechs across 4 regions with $300M+ in transaction volume.

At that scale and team size, there's no dedicated system tracking which fintechs are going quiet, which wallets have gone dormant, or who's about to churn.

I built the solution and sent it as my pitch.
